# Audio-Spectrum-LED-Analyser
Just an old-school visualizer that looks sick !

# To Do List
1. Measured frequency incorrect -> Check sound sensor datasheet
2. Also need to check if I am using the correct sampling frequency
3. Have a look at the ADC timing -> Check for inconsistent firing times

# Improvements
1. Use an external RAM module to increase 512 KB of UNO SRAM --> Allows for more resolution in FFT calculation
2. Use more LEDS for a bigger frequency visual spectrum
3.Perhaps use an additional sensor and combine ADC readings for more accuracy
